### Migration from WordPress to Github Pages 

* Current site: https://kenyansapplyingtousuniversities.com/
* Site in progress: http://applicants-254.github.io 

* There's no reason for us to be on WordPress and pay $4.00 per month for an ad-free site.
* We're thus planning on moving to Github Pages once our WordPress subscription expires in August 2018.
* We'll also transfer the domain name so that our readers don't get any disruptions.
* To make this site, we found this [blog post](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) useful.
